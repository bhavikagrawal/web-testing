Testing is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs.

Development testing is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development 
lifecycle.

* Front End Testing verifies the user-facing interface of a software application. It requires knowledge about requirements related to user experience, but not about the database and the back-end mechanics.

* Back End Testing checks the efficacy of the functionality on the server and database side of the software. This is necessary to ensure that interdependent components are interacting accurately so as to produce, process, and store data in the most efficient way. It requires knowledge of databases such as SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, DB2, etc.

Types Of Testing (Frontend)
1. UNIT TESTING (Backend/Frontend) - input validations and calculations
    If you have a piece of code with Single Responsibility, you likely want to write a unit test for it.

    Test Suiuts - Code organisation and to execuete them individually.
2. ACCEPTANCE TESTING / INTEGRATION TESTING
    It is to test if the actual unit is accepted/works perfectly in whole model/system.

3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING (Cross Browser/OS/Devices)
    Testing visual/rendered result of your code(final product)

4. ACCESSIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE TESTING

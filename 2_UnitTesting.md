## Unit Testing
Testing small units of individual independent code is termed as **Unit Testing**.

Statement - executable instruction that tells the computer what to perform

```
    Ex. let sum = 1 + 2;
```

Function - a group of statements that can be executed as a unit

```
    Ex. function sum(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
```

Branch - a statement that can be executed as a unit

```
    Ex. if (a > b) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return b;
    }
```

Line - a line code that can be executed as a unit(it can/can't be a statement)

```
    Ex. let sum = 1 + 2;
```

## Code Covereage
The extent to which the source code of a software program or an application will get executed during testing is what is termed as **Code Coverage**.

Use `-- --coverage` to run the test with code coverage.
